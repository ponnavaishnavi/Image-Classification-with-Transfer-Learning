# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using transfer learning with pre-trained convolutional neural networks in TensorFlow and Keras. It's built to run seamlessly on **Google Colab**, making it easy to experiment with GPU acceleration.

---

## 📌 Overview

Instead of training a deep neural network from scratch, this project leverages **transfer learning** — using the feature-extracting capabilities of models like **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, or **MobileNetV2**, pre-trained on ImageNet. A custom classification head is added to adapt to a new dataset of images.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Requirements

You can run the notebook in Colab without installing anything locally. If you want to run it elsewhere:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies:

TensorFlow 2.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

seaborn (optional, for visualizations)

🏗️ Model Architecture

Load a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) without the top classification layer.

Freeze the base layers to retain learned features.

Add a custom classifier head (Dense layers + Dropout).

Train on your dataset.

Optionally, fine-tune some base layers to improve performance.

Example:

base_model = tf.keras.applications.VGG16(include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3), weights='imagenet')
base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze base

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

💡 Tips for Best Performance

Use ImageDataGenerator or tf.data.Dataset with augmentation.

Normalize input images (rescale=1./255).

Start with frozen layers, then fine-tune.

Use a small learning rate when fine-tuning.
